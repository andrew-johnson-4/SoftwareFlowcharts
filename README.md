## Format

Currently efforts are being made to document installation of a variety of projects on GitHub.
Each GitHub project gets an install.yaml file in `github/username/project` to describe the installation process.

## Example install.yaml

```
windows:
  shell: "cargo install lsts"
linux:
  shell: "cargo install lsts"
macos:
  shell: "cargo install lsts"
```
